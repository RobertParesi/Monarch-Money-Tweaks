### Monarch Tweaks Getting Started

If you're starting with Monarch Money Tweaks (MMT), it's recommended to start with the following three steps, all explained further below:

1. Settings / Display for initial **Monarch Tweaks Settings**.
2. Settings / Categories to further setup **Fixed & Flexible Spending**
3. Accounts to setup **Account Groups**.

### Monarch Tweaks - Fixed vs Flexible
![Settings](/images/MTFixed.png)

You can further define expenses **on the Group level** by either "Fixed Spending" or "Flexible Spending" when looking at Trends report and Tags report.   Select Settings / Categories and check the box as appropriate.   If there are no Account Groups that have been checked, these reports will not breakdown the expenses.   MMT does not use the Fixed and Flexbile Spending setting inside Monarch since MMT is only set at the Group level.

### Account Groups 

Account Groups allow you to break out your transactions (Income & Expenses) as well as your Accounts (Assets & Liabilities).   Select Accounts and then Edit each account to assign an Account Group.  There are different scenerios and combindations that Monarch Money users use them in:

    * Personal vs Business - ie: "Personal", "Business" and "Both".
    * Household Members - ie: "Your Name", "Their Name", "Kids", "Personal", "Both", etc.
    * How taxed - "Taxed" and "Tax Deferred"
    * How Managed (Investments) - "Managed" and "Non Managed"
    * ... or anything else you want to Group reports by

* The "Sub-Report" allows you to look at the report in different ways. 
* The "How report is grouped" allows you to pick the Grouping of the data in the report.  Toggle any column header to sort the report in Ascending or Decending order.
* The "Account Group Filter" will only show once you have edited each of your Accounts and assigned your custom Account Group.

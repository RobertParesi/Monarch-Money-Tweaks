### Monarch Money Tweaks Getting Started

It's recommended to start with the following three steps, all explained further below:

1. Settings / Display for initial **Monarch Tweaks Settings**.
2. Settings / Categories to further setup **Fixed & Flexible Spending**
3. Accounts to setup **Account Groups**.

### Monarch Money Tweaks - Fixed vs Flexible

You can further specify expenses at the Group level by choosing between "Fixed Spending" and "Flexible Spending" within the Trends and Net Income reports. To do this, navigate to **Settings > Categories** and select the appropriate option. Please note, MMT does not utilize the Fixed and Flexible Spending settings within Monarch, as MMT operates solely at the Group level.

### Monarch Money Tweaks - Account Groups 

You can further specify Account Groups to organize your Accounts in to custom groups. To do this, go to **Accounts** and **edit** each account to assign an Account Group in the **Account Group - (MM Tweaks)** field. 

Monarch Money users utilize them in various scenarios and combinations for the Monarch Money Tweaks reports:

    * Personal vs Business - "Personal", "Business", "ABC Company"
    * Household Members - "Your Name", "Their Name", "Kids", "Both"
    * How taxed - "Taxed", "Tax Deferred"
    * How managed - "Managed", "Non Managed"
    * Types - "Credit Cards", "Retirement", "Trust", "Homes", "Loans"
    * ... or anything else you want to Group reports by

Personally I did the following:
   * Investment accounts: I put "Managed" or "Non Managed" since I have an advisor for some investments and not others.
   * Credit cards: I put "Credit Cards" so they are all grouped together.
   * House, Cars, all other accounts: I put "Trust" or "Non Trust" depending on where it is titled.

If you are simply separating your finances with your partner, you may want to either put your name, their name or "Both".

### Monarch Money Tweaks - Reports (Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investments)

All four reports use the same flex-grid, structure and options:

![Settings](/images/MT_V3_99.png)

* The "Sub Report" allows you to look at the report in different ways. 
* The "How report is grouped" allows you to pick the Grouping of the data in the report.  Toggle any column header to sort the report in Ascending or Decending order.
* The "Account Group Filter" will only show once you have edited each of your Accounts and assigned your custom Account Group.

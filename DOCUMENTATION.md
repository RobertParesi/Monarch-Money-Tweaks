## ðŸ“– Documentation & Help:

If you're starting with Monarch Money Tweaks (MMT), it's recommended to start by exploring Account Groups. Creating custom account groups can enhance the usefulness of the four reports in MMT by providing clearer organization and insights. Be sure to review the Account Groups section located at the bottom of this page to get started.

**All four reports (Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investment) follow the same flex-grid and structure:**

* The "Sub-Report" allows you to look at the report in different ways. 
* The "Group" allows you to pick the Grouping of the data in the report.  Toggle any column header to sort the report in Ascending or Decending order
* The "Account Groups" will only show once you have edited each of your Accounts and assigned your custom Account Group

## Account Groups 
> Extension added field found when **editing** an **Institution Account** in Monarch Money:

Account Groups allow you to break out your transactions (Income & Expenses) as well as your Accounts (Assets & Liabilities).

There are different scenerios that Monarch Money users use them in:

    * Personal vs Business
    * Household Members
    * Tax and Tax Deferred
    * Managed vs Non Managed
    * Family vs Kids
    * Credit Cards
    * Loans

For me personally, I have my accounts labeled five ways:  **Personal** (checking, house, cars, etc.), **Credit Cards** (all my credit cards), **Loans** (all other liabilities), **Managed** (investments managed) and **Non Managed** (investments non managed).
    
      
**Personal & Business**

If your accounts also have business accounts, consider adding "Personal", "Business" and "Both".

**Household Members**

If your accounts are designated as either yours personally, your partner's personally as well as maybe joint, you could assign each checking, savings, credit card, etc. account with either "Your Name", "Their Name", or "Both". Example:  "Jerry", "Elaine", "Both" rather than just "Personal".

**Tax and Tax Deferred**

If your accounts are designated as accounts you can touch (taxable) versus IRAs and other Tax Deferred accounts, you could assign each checking, savings, investment, etc. account with either "Taxable" or "Tax Deferred". 

**Managed and Non Managed**

If some accounts are managed by an advisor and some are not, you can assign "Managed" and "Non Managed" to different accounts to compare performance of both types of accounts. 

**Family vs Kids**

If there are investments or credit cards for kids use, you could further designate with "Family" or "Kids".

## Fixed vs Flexible Spending
> Extension added field found when selecting Settings / Categories in Monarch Money:

You can further define expenses **on the Group level** by either "Fixed Spending" or "Flexible Spending" when looking at Trends report and Tags report.   Select Settings / Categories and check the box as appropriate.   If there are no Account Groups that have been checked, these reports will not breakdown the expenses.

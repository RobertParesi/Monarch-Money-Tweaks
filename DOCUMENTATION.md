### Monarch Tweaks Getting Started

### Monarch Tweaks - Fixed vs Flexible

You can further specify expenses at the Group level by choosing between "Fixed Spending" and "Flexible Spending" within the Trends and Net Income reports. To do this, navigate to **Settings > Categories** and select the appropriate option. Please note, MMT does not utilize the Fixed and Flexible Spending settings within Monarch, as MMT operates solely at the Group level.

### Monarch Tweaks - Account Groups 

You can further specify Account Groups to organize your Accounts in to custom groups. To do this, go to **Accounts** and **edit** each account to assign an Account Group in the **Account Group - (MM Tweaks)** field. Monarch Money users utilize them in various scenarios and combinations for the Monarch Money Tweaks reports:

    * Personal vs Business - ie: "Personal", "Business" and "Both".
    * Household Members - ie: "Your Name", "Their Name", "Kids", "Personal", "Both", etc.
    * How taxed - "Taxed" and "Tax Deferred"
    * How Managed (Investments) - "Managed" and "Non Managed"
    * ... or anything else you want to Group reports by

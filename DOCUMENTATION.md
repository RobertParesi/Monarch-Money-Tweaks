### Monarch Money Tweaks - Fixed vs Flexible

You can further specify expenses at the Group level by choosing between "Fixed Spending" and "Flexible Spending" within the Trends and Net Income reports. To do this, navigate to **Settings > Categories** and select the appropriate option. Please note, MMT does not utilize the Fixed and Flexible Spending settings within Monarch, as MMT operates solely at the Group level.

### Monarch Money Tweaks - Account Groups 

You can further specify Account Groups to organize your Accounts in to custom groups. To do this, go to **Reports** and **Accounts** and select the **>** for each account to assign Account Group and more.  Click on the **...** in the upper-right in the side-panel to access this screen.

Monarch Money users utilize them in various scenarios and combinations for the Monarch Money Tweaks reports:

    * Personal vs Business - "Personal", "Business", "ABC Company"
    * Household Members - "Your Name", "Their Name", "Kids", "Both"
    * How taxed - "Taxed", "Tax Deferred"
    * How managed - "Managed", "Non Managed"
    * Types - "Credit Cards", "Retirement", "Trust", "Homes", "Loans"
    * ... or anything else you want to Group reports by

Personally I did the following:
   * Investment accounts: I put "Managed" or "Non Managed" since I have an advisor for some investments and not others.
   * Credit cards: I put "Credit Cards" so they are all grouped together.
   * House, Cars, all other accounts: I put "Trust" or "Non Trust" depending on where it is titled.


### Monarch Money Tweaks - Reports (Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investments)

All four reports use the same flex-grid, structure and options:

* The "Sub Report" feature enables you to view the report from different perspectives.
* The "How report is grouped" option allows you to select the data grouping. Click on any column header to sort the report in ascending or descending order.
* The "Account Group Filter" will appear only after you have edited your accounts and assigned your custom account groups.

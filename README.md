# üôè Quotes from Monarch Money users  
- _This is fantastic! I just installed Monarch Money Tweaks and it makes up for some serious gaps in Monarch Money reporting. The trends report is exactly what I was looking for and probably the main reason I continue to run Quicken in parallel (which I have used for 15+ yrs). Thanks so much for doing this!_

- _Doing the Lord's work_

- _Love that they keep updating. Love it_

- _Amazing work! Thank you!_

- _Left to spend is huge! Thank you._

- _I just want to say how much I appreciate the work done on this, it's really helpful._

- _Great work as always!_

- _Monarch Money on Steroids!_  

- _If you are a numbers person, you need this extension!_

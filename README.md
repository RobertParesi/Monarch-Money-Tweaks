# 🙏 Quotes from Monarch Money users  
- _This is fantastic! I just installed Monarch Money Tweaks and it makes up for some serious gaps in Monarch Money reporting. The trends report is exactly what I was looking for and probably the main reason I continue to run Quicken in parallel (which I have used for 15+ yrs). Thanks so much for doing this!_

## Contributions:

This GitHub repository is currently not set up for contributions, but I welcome your ideas and feedback. Please feel free to reach out via private message or email to discuss any thoughts you may have.

One important guideline for this extension is that it will not include any features that add, change, or delete records in Monarch. This decision is made to maintain a high level of trust and confidence in the extension's use, ensuring that it does not impact anyone's data. Thank you for your understanding!

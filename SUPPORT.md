### Monarch Money Tweaks — Ideas

This extension focuses primarily on Reports (Trends, Net Income, Accounts, Investments).

Please avoid creating discussions about modifying Monarch’s screens or features such as Transactions, Snapshot, Budgets, Recurring, Goals, Advice, Monarch’s graphs, or hiding/modifying  fields. This extension is also not connected to Monarch Money’s mobile apps (iPhone & Android).

Monarch Money has its own roadmap and dedicated development teams. This project is a hobby effort I’m sharing with the Monarch Money community, done for fun and free of charge. I’m happy to help within this scope, and I kindly ask that you respect my time and effort.

Thank you for your understanding.

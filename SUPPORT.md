### Monarch Money Tweaks - Support

For help with the product, please see the DOCUMENTATION file first.   

Next, if you need additional help, please see the Discussions link at the top of this GitHub.

I want to clarify that this extension is not intended for requesting new features or wish list ideas for Monarch Money.  This extension is primarily focused on Reports **(Trends, Net Income, Accounts, Investments)**.

Please refrain from creating discussions about modifying Monarch's screens and features such as in Transactions, Snapshot, Budgets, Recurring, Goals, or Advice, any of Monarch's graphs or hiding money fields within Monarch. Any such posts will be removed. This extension has no connection to Monarch Money’s mobile apps (iPhone & Android) and does not pertain to their core platform beyond the scope I’ve described.

Monarch Money has its own roadmap and dedicated development teams. What I am offering here is a hobby project, done for fun and free of charge. While I’m happy to help within this scope, I kindly ask for your respect regarding my time and effort. Monarch Money has a very diverse and large audience, people starting out to financial independent retirees. This extension is mainly focused not on any budgeting features but on giving additional reporting.

I also ask that you use the extension before posting in this discussion forum, especially for new features.

Thank you for your understanding.

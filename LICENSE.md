* All rights to the product and its source code are exclusively reserved by me. 
* Any use beyond personal purposes requires prior explicit permission.
* The source code may be used solely for personal use. 
* Forked repositories must be kept **PRIVATE** and are not permitted to be made **PUBIC**. 
* Any modifications to the source code must not be disclosed or shared publicly

Note: If you are thinking of using ChatGPT or AI over the source code to make Tweaks do what you want it to do, feel free but I can't support it.  I've now seen twice where forked repositories ran through AI has put sensitive financial information (bank names and balances) in forked public source code.   Please, if you fork this repository playing with the source code, first make the repository **PRIVATE**.

### Beta Testers
🐛🧪 If you are computer savy and/or still using the Tampermonkey script, contact me if you would like to be a Tweaks beta tester.

### Source Contributions
The Monarch Money Tweaks extension (source code/GitHub) is not configured for community contributions. Factors such as security, code bloat, maintainability, consistency, App Store reviews, long-term support, and my available time influenced this choice.  Any forked GitHubs must be made PRIVATE.

### Feature Suggestions
My Monarch Money Tweaks focus is mostly on the four additional reports: **Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investments**  I do not wish to add any features to Budgets, Recurring and Goals because they are heavily changing in Monarch. There are also areas in Monarch which is deep in their React code such as their Graphs, Filters and Transaction screen which is out of the scope of Tweaks. Finally, I'm also not looking at just adding small impact visual items, but more items that help with digging deeper into finances, especially on a data mining, trends and investment level. 

That said, I genuinely welcome your feedback. Please share any thoughts or suggestions in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository.

Additionally, this extension does not include any features that add, modify, or delete records in Monarch. This is a deliberate choice to maintain a high level of trust and ensure that the extension does not impact or manipulate your data in any way.

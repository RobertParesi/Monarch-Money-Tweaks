### Beta Testers
🐛🧪🦊 If you use **Firefox** and are computer savy, contact me if you would like to be a Tweaks beta tester.

### Source Contributions
The Monarch Money Tweaks extension (source code/GitHub) is not configured for community contributions. Factors such as security, code bloat, maintainability, consistency, App Store reviews, long-term support, and my available time influenced this choice.  Any forked GitHubs must be made PRIVATE.

### Feature Suggestions
My Monarch Money Tweaks focus is mostly on the four additional reports: **Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investments**  I do not wish to add any features to Budgets and Goals because they are heavily changing in Monarch.  That said, I genuinely welcome your feedback. Please share any thoughts or suggestions in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository.

Additionally, this extension does not include any features that add, modify, or delete records in Monarch. This is a deliberate choice to maintain a high level of trust and ensure that the extension does not impact or manipulate your data in any way.

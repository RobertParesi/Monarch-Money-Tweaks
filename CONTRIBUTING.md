The Monarch Money Tweaks extension (source code/GitHub) is not configured for community contributions. Factors such as security, code bloat, maintainability, consistency, website reviews, long-term support, and my available time influenced this choice.

My Monarch Money Tweaks focus is mostly on the four additional reports (**Trends, Net Income, Accounts and Investments**) for many of the reasons above.  There are a bunch of Tweaks outside these areas, but they were done in the early version of this extension.

That said, I genuinely welcome your feedback in those areas. Please share any thoughts or suggestions in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository.

Additionally, this extension does not include any features that add, modify, or delete records in Monarch. This is a deliberate choice to maintain a high level of trust and ensure that the extension does not impact or manipulate your data in any way.

## Monarch Money Tweaks - Contributing

The Monarch Money Tweaks extension (source code/GitHub) is not configured for community contributions. I understand that at times, users may want to customize or add their own code, but Iâ€™ve carefully considered this decision. Factors such as security, code bloat, maintainability, consistency, website reviews, long-term support, and my available time influenced this choice.

That said, I genuinely welcome your feedback. Please share any thoughts or suggestions in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository.

Additionally, this extension does not include any features that add, modify, or delete records in Monarch. This is a deliberate choice to maintain a high level of trust and ensure that the extension does not impact or manipulate your data in any way.

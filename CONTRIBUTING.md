## Contributing and Discussions:

Monarch Money Tweaks extension (source-code/GitHub) is not set up for community contributions.   While I understand that there may be times someone may want to add their own code, I've put a lot of thought into this. I decided not to go down this path, specifically because of security, code-bloat, growing legs, consistancy, Website reviews, long-term support, my extra time and other factors)

However, I welcome your feedback.  Please only use the **Discussions** area of this Github. 

This extension dos not include any features that **add, change, or delete records** in Monarch. This decision is made to maintain a high level of trust and confidence in the extension's use, ensuring that it does not impact anyone's data.

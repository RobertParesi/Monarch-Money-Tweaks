Thanks for using Monarch Money Tweaks. I want to assure you that this extension respects your privacy and data security.

### Security and Privacy

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy. This extension utilizes the Monarch Money GraphQL API, which is developed by Monarch Money and integrated into their web app and mobile framework, report graphs, and other features. The extension uses this **same security token stored by Monarch Money**, guaranteeing it's using the same methods for accessing your data that they designed.  

The extension undergoes a **thorough verification process by Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), and Apple (Safari) with every update**. Prior to being made available to the public, it is carefully reviewed by these platforms to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring the extension's safety and security.

Extensions are designed to request only the data and permissions necessary for their functionality. During installation, users are informed of these requests. I am pleased to say that **the extension's manifest requests no permissions beyond access within Monarch Money's application domain** and has **no background processes at all**, ensuring that your financial information remains secure and confined within its intended boundaries.  You can confirm both of this in the details tab of the extension.

### Data Collection and Modification

Your browsing experience is completely private and unaffected by data collection. This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. This extension does not modify, update or delete any of your Monarch Money data.

### Data Usage and Tracking

The extension does not send or receive data from third-party servers.  We do not implement any analytics, tracking, or data collection mechanisms.

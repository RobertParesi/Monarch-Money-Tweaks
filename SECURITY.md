**📣 Over 2,300 active users!**

Thanks for checking out Monarch Money Tweaks. I want to assure you that this extension respects your privacy and data security. I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy.  

### Security and Privacy

This extension utilizes the public Monarch Money GraphQL API (Application Program Interface) for single endpoint data access in Monarch Money.  This is **their own API** integrated into their web app, mobile apps and retail shopping extensions.  The extension uses this **same security token stored by Monarch Money**, guaranteeing it's using the same methods (token & API) for accessing your data in the way they designed.  

When this extension runs, it makes additional calls to their API using their Security Token and adds additional functionality to the Monarch Money web application. Their API does not expose your passwords, account numbers or bank credentials.

This extension is designed to request only the data and permissions necessary for their functionality.  The extension's manifest **requests no permissions beyond access within Monarch Money's application domain** and has **no background processes at all**, ensuring that your financial information remains secure and confined within its intended boundaries - you and Monarch.  

The extensions **source code is public** and available for anyone to review. It has been around for two years now, and I am a moderator in the Monarch Money Reddit community forum.   Currently, there are over 2,000 active users using this extension.

Finally, the extension undergoes a **thorough verification process by Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), and Apple (Safari) with every update**. Prior to being made available to the public, it is carefully reviewed by these platforms to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring the extension's safety and security.
